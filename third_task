/*Approximating Euler's number "e" (the base of the natural logarithm)

The natural number can e=2.7182818… can be obtained by the following infinite sum:

    1    1    1    1    1
e = ── + ── + ── + ── + ── + …
    0!   1!   2!   3!   4!

Write a program to compute it with the first 20 terms! Note that the factorial can be a high number, use a double data type to store it!

Hint: if you have used nested loops, try to simplify your solution! A single loop is enough to solve the problem.*/
