/*Approximating Euler's number "e" (the base of the natural logarithm)

The natural number can e=2.7182818… can be obtained by the following infinite sum:

    1    1    1    1    1
e = ── + ── + ── + ── + ── + …
    0!   1!   2!   3!   4!

Write a program to compute it with the first 20 terms! Note that the factorial can be a high number, use a double data type to store it!

Hint: if you have used nested loops, try to simplify your solution! A single loop is enough to solve the problem.*/

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    double e = 1;
    double a = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++){
        a *= i;
        e += 1/a;
    }

    printf("%f\n", e);

    return 0;
}
